# workout-tracker

## Description

This is a simple workout tracker app that will allow a user to view create and track daily workouts. Users can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. Users can also track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, users can track the distance traveled. As a user, you can:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
